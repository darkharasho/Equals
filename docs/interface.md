# Tabs and Settings

Equals supports multiple tabs, persistent settings, and a configurable
appearance.

## Tabs

- Each tab remembers its own lines and results.
- Use keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+T` new tab, `Ctrl+Tab` cycle tabs, `Ctrl+W` close tab.

## Settings
- Theme: toggle between light and dark modes.
- Gradient: choose the window border colours.
- Size: set window dimensions and default font size.
