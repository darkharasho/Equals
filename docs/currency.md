# Currency Support

Equals can format common currency symbols and convert between currencies.

## Symbols

The calculator recognizes the following symbols: `$`, `€`, `£`, `¥`, `₹`, and `₩`.

## Conversions

Convert values using ISO codes, symbols, or currency names:

```
10 USD to EUR
10¥ to USD
¥10 to USD
¥10 to $
10 Yen to USD
```

The app fetches rates from an online API and caches them for an hour.

## Refreshing Rates

Use **Refresh Rates** in the Settings panel to clear the cache and reload the latest exchange rates.
